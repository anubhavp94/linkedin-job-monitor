## Requirements
Below is a link for job postings in LinkedIn. Make a simple browser extension which monitors this URL every hour and make a list of all the job postings and sends a browser notification.

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=4314608036&f_E=4&f_TPR=r3600&geoId=105214831&keywords=product%20manager&origin=JOB_SEARCH_PAGE_JOB_FILTER&refresh=true

# Important considerations
Keep it simple. Do not add fancy features.

Add the ability to configure the URL to monitor.
